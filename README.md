# Even-Numbers-

An attempt at displaying a list of even numbers using JavaScript and displaying the results in the corresponding HTML file. The javascript works using the console, but displays
incorrectly in the div element I made in the index.html file. If anyone has any solutions, feel free to look at my code and let me know. Thanks!
